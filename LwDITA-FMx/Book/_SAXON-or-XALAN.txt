
As of 2.0.06, the DITA-FMx Book app import XSLT (bookmap2fmbook.xsl) is 
set up to be compatible with SAXON. This is the default XSLT processor in 
FrameMaker 13.0.1 and later. If you're using FM 13.0.1 or later, you 
should be fine with the default setup.

If you're using FM13.0.0 or earlier, you'll probably want to use the XALAN 
version of bookmap2fmbook.xsl. Just copy the file bookmap2fmbook-XALAN.xsl
to bookmap2fmbook.xsl.

As of FM11, the maker.ini file allows you to switch between XALAN and SAXON
XSLT processors, by changing the setting in the XSLTProcessors section. You
may want to change this default, and if you do, be sure to choose the right
DITA-FMx import XSLT, by copying the appropriate file to bookmap2fmbook.xsl
