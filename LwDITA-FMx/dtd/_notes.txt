
DTD notes and observations

1) topic and map @domains attribute defaults are not in sync. 
   Assuming that map/@domains should include "(map xdita-c)" and change "(hi-d)" to "(topic hi-d)" 

2) data element models differ between map and topic. map doesn't allow PCDATA and is missing 2 attributes.
   Assuming they will be the same .. use topic model for map.

3) map model doesn't include @outputclass .. topic does.

4) would be nice if topicref allowed @processing-role
