
Formatting of <hazardstatement> elements.

- controlled by Hazard table definition that uses a special
  structural model as defined in the default DITA-FMx Book
  application.
- must be 2 rows x 2 cols

- if both rows are "body" rows (default) ..
  - 1st column is straddled and symbol inserted within
  - top, left, and bottom ruling is removed form first column
  - header label added to row 1, cell 2

- if first row is a "header" row (in tpl~topicref-HAZALT.fm)
  - header row is straddled and header label added
  - no ruling is modified
  - symbol added to row 2, cell 1

- for both types of hazard tables, the header row coloring is
  controlled by color definitions that use the naming 
  convention of "hazard-<hazardtype>".

- header label text is controlled by paragraph tags named
  "hazard.head.<hazardtype>", these tags are applied to the
  fm-hazardhead element (applied by the EDD).
